aci-D2N114,"The patient, Julie, is seeing the doctor about her frequent and severe headaches. Julie has been struggling with headaches for years, initially associated with her menstrual cycle and stress. However, recently her headaches have been more frequent and severe. The headaches are mostly on the right side, behind her eye, and have a pulsating sensation. Julie has noticed that exercise, specifically jogging, triggers worse headaches. She has also been experiencing ringing in her ears and occasional blurred vision on the side of her vision. Julie does not have any numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face. 

During the physical examination, the doctor finds papilledema, swelling behind the eye, and conducts a neurological exam with normal results. The doctor suspects idiopathic intracranial hypertension, characterized by increased pressure in the brain without a known cause. Further tests, such as an MRI to check for other conditions and a spinal tap to evaluate and potentially decrease the pressure, are recommended. The doctor also suggests a complete eye exam by a neuro-ophthalmologist. Medications can be used to decrease the pressure in the brain and alleviate symptoms, and lifestyle changes, including exercise and weight loss, are important for treatment.

The patient, Mr. Jackson, is a 45-year-old male with a history of type two diabetes and mild intermittent asthma. He presents to the doctor with right elbow pain, which he attributes to playing tennis. The pain is located on the outside of the elbow and is described as sharp, stabbing, and very painful when in use. The doctor asks about any trauma or worsening factors, as well as other symptoms, such as pain radiating down the arm or shoulder, but the patient reports none. He has tried over-the-counter pain medications and ice, but they provide only temporary relief.

The doctor discusses the patient's medical history, including his diabetes, asthma, allergies, and past surgical procedures.

The patient, Kyle, initially went to see his primary care physician (PCP) for a cough, which was diagnosed as bronchitis. However, a chest x-ray revealed a lung nodule, which was confirmed by a CT scan. Kyle was then referred to the doctor he is currently seeing for further evaluation. Kyle expresses his nervousness about the situation.

The doctor assures Kyle that they will work together as a team and offers support to alleviate his nervousness. They discuss the duration of Kyle's cough, which started about three months ago after he loaded hay while taking care of his horses. Kyle mentions that he exercises frequently, especially biking, and rarely gets sick. The cough has since gone away.

The doctor shares their own love for biking and the new trails in the area. They promise to help Kyle and even suggest going for a bike ride together. The doctor then asks about Kyle's rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and how he manages it. Kyle mentions taking methotrexate and staying active, with occasional problems in his hands but no recent flares.

The doctor notes that Kyle had previously smoked but has quit seven years ago, which is good for his health. They inquire about any pain or shortness of breath, to which Kyle responds negatively. The doctor asks about family history, specifically any lung cancer or other malignancies, to which Kyle mentions his mother's breast cancer but states that she is doing well.

The doctor proceeds with a physical examination, finding no abnormalities except for minor swelling in Kyle's knuckles due to his RA. The doctor reviews the results of the chest CT, which showed a two-centimeter nodule in the right upper lobe of Kyle's lung. They note its smooth appearance and the absence of emphysematous disease.

Based on their assessment, the doctor recommends conducting pulmonary function tests (PFT) to establish a baseline for lung function and schedules a PET-CT scan to determine the metabolic activity of the nodule, which can indicate if it's cancerous or inflammatory. The doctor proposes removing the nodule through video-assisted thoracoscopy, which would involve three small incisions on the side of Kyle's right chest. They will use a camera and scope to remove the nodule and a small portion of the lung under general anesthesia. Kyle would stay in the hospital for one night and have a chest tube until the following day.

Regarding his RA, the doctor advises Kyle to continue following up with his rheumatologist and adhering to his medication therapy. The doctor asks if Kyle has any questions or concerns, to which Kyle expresses his fear but acknowledges that he will be okay. The doctor reassures him and goes to get the necessary paperwork to proceed with treatment."

The patient denies any intention to harm himself or others. The doctor proceeds with a physical exam and finds crackles and 1+ pitting edema in the patient's lungs and lower extremities. The doctor orders a chest x-ray and reviews the results, finding no evidence of airspace disease. The labs also come back normal, ruling out infection. The doctor diagnoses Lawrence with an acute heart failure exacerbation and prescribes Lasix and daily weight monitoring. For his diabetes, the doctor orders a hemoglobin A1c test and recommends follow-up with an endocrinologist and an eye exam.

The patient, Mrs. Anderson, presents with left shoulder pain that has lasted for a week. She took Tylenol for a few days, but it didn't help. The pain started after she was in a gymnastics class and may have occurred due to a certain move. The doctor examines her and determines that there is no broken bone or fracture but suspects a joint injury. The doctor suggests using ibuprofen three times a day for a week and recommends using ice or a heat pad if the pain persists. The patient mentions a past surgery on her left arm, but the doctor doesn't believe it is related to the current pain. The doctor advises resting the left arm and not carrying heavy weights, using the right hand instead. If the pain continues after three weeks, the patient should return for further evaluation. The doctor may consider another x-ray at that time. Medications and procedures are ordered as discussed. The patient hopes that ibuprofen will help and asks if she can call the doctor or make another appointment if the pain worsens. The doctor suggests trying Advil or Aleve and thanks the patient."

Kayla Ward, a 7th grade student, is at the doctor's office for a new visit with her mother regarding her acne, which started two years ago. She has been using Persa-Gel and washing regularly, which has been somewhat helpful. There are no associated symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or pain. Kayla lives with her parents, sister, and pets (a dog, bird, and bunnies). She also participates in sports. Dr. Price asks about the acne on her chest and back, to which Kayla responds that it's not too bad and that she has used over-the-counter washes and Persa-Gel. Kayla's current skincare routine involves wiping her face down in the morning and using the ELF Super Clarity cleanser, toner, and Persa-Gel at night. She sometimes uses the cleanser in the morning if needed. Kayla describes today as a good day for her skin. She does not experience acne flare-ups with her periods and has been getting regular periods for about two years. The biggest flare-up occurred when she started school sports. Mrs. Ward, Kayla's mother, mentions that Kayla has been diligent with her skincare regimen, but it hasn't helped as much as they hoped. Dr. Price performs a full examination and diagnoses Kayla with mild to moderate acne, primarily comodonal with a small inflammatory component. He recommends starting with topical therapy, including washing her face with a mild cleanser in the morning, using a noncomedogenic moisturizer with SPF 30, and applying adapalene, 0.1% cream, in the evening. He advises starting with a few nights a week and gradually increasing to nightly use. If the prescribed medication is expensive or not covered by insurance, over-the-counter alternatives can be tried. Dr. Price also mentions that Kayla has multiple benign moles, which appear normal and do not raise concerns. The next follow-up is scheduled in six months. Kayla agrees to the treatment plan and thanks the doctor. The doctor instructs her to reach out if she has any questions or concerns before the next visit."

virtscribe-D2N103,"In this patient-doctor dialogue, the doctor is seeing Melissa Sanchez for a follow-up after her mitral valve repair. The doctor notes that at her previous appointment, she was doing well from a cardiac standpoint and recommended she continue with the same medication. However, an ECG taken on 12/26/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and t-wave inversion anteriorly. The patient also has a history of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, asthma, and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease. 

During the appointment, the doctor asks about any new symptoms and the patient reports occasional chest pains and shallow breathing. The symptoms last for a few minutes and then disappear for a couple of weeks. The patient is taking her medications regularly, including coumadin, lasix, and atenolol. She mentions that the atenolol initially made her irritable but she has gotten used to it. 

The doctor performs a physical exam and notes no JVD or abnormal breath sounds in the head and neck and lungs. The patient's heart rhythm is irregularly irregular due to atrial fibrillation. The doctor also checks the patient's belly and extremities, finding no pain or peripheral edema. 

Based on the exam and ECG, the doctor determines that the patient's heart valves are working well and she is recovering nicely from the surgery. The atrial fibrillation is well controlled with medication. The doctor recommends continuing with the current medication regimen and encourages the patient to stay active. 

The doctor schedules a follow-up appointment in about six to nine months, as there are no immediate concerns from a cardiac perspective. The patient thanks the doctor and the appointment concludes."
virtscribe-D2N104,"In this dialogue, the patient, Judy Gomez, visits the doctor for ongoing management of her psoriatic arthritis. The doctor asks about her well-being and mentions the previous discussion about decreasing her prednisone dose. Judy confirms that she is now only taking one prednisone pill and reports that it seems to be enough, although she occasionally takes an extra one when experiencing extra pain in her feet. The doctor notes that they are still on track for discontinuing the prednisone and asks about the effectiveness of methotrexate in relieving joint pain. Judy confirms that it helped, but she had to skip a week of methotrexate due to concerns about its interference with a COVID vaccine. She experienced severe symptoms during that week but resumed taking methotrexate and felt better. The doctor expresses the need to monitor methotrexate due to its high-risk nature and mentions the need for blood work in the future. Judy asks about the bruises she is experiencing, and the doctor attributes them to the prednisone, assuring her that they may disappear once she stops taking it. The doctor then examines Judy's joints and concludes that her treatment is progressing well. They decide to discontinue prednisone, continue with methotrexate, and schedule a follow-up appointment in three months."
