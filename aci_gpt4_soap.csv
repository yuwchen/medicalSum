The funduscopic examination revealed papilledema  swelling behind the eye. A neurological exam showed intact cranial nerves one through twelve and normal reflexes. The musculoskeletal exam identified a normal gait. ","The doctor is concerned that the patient has idiopathic intracranial hypertension, where there is an increase of pressure in the brain without any known cause. The symptoms of headaches, worsening with activity, ringing in the ears, and changes in vision align with this. There is concern that if the pressure continues to increase, there might be permanent changes to the patient's vision. Further testing will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. An MRI will be completed to identify any potential contributing conditions. A spinal tap will be performed to evaluate the pressure in the brain and potentially alleviate some of the patient's discomfort if there is indeed elevated pressure. The patient is also scheduled to be seen by a neuroophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. If the condition is confirmed, there are medications available to manage and prevent increases in intracranial pressure.

aci-D2N116,"The patient, Bobby, presented with pain in his right shoulder which has been going on for a few weeks. The pain initiated after he was involved in some physically demanding work in his backyard and was severe enough to bother him during movement and at night, especially when he slept on the side of his pain. Bobby had some history of damage to that shoulder from his youth. He selftreated with Advil and ice to dull the pain slightly. He does not have any numbness but has felt soreness in both his feet and ankle joints due to his physical activity. His wife suggests he may be dehydrated. ","Upon examination, Bobby was found to have a good overall health condition. Physically, Bobby has unrestricted movement of his arm but experienced some pain during movement, especially on the outer side of the right shoulder. The doctor noted a minor limitation in the active and passive range of motion and tenderness at the humerus' greater tuberosity. Neurovascular examination found a good hand grip, a capillary refill of less than 3 seconds, and intact sensation. An xray indicated no fractures. ","The doctor assessed that Bobby likely has tendinopathy in the rotator cuff of his right shoulder. He suggests ordering an MRI for appropriate diagnosis and recommends referring Bobby to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks for treatment.

aci-D2N117,"Mr. Jackson, a 45 years old male with a history of Diabetes TypeII and mild intermittent asthma came to the hospital complaining of right elbow pain for the past three weeks. He shared that the pain started around the same time he began playing tennis frequently. The elbow pain intensifies with movements, and he scores it as an eight on a scale of zero to ten when using his elbow and three when at rest. The pain is located on the outside part of the elbow. It is sharp, stabbing, and shooting. Pain relief medications like Tylenol and Ibuprofen provide short term relief, and icing the elbow doesn't seem to be effective. He denied any recent injuries or trauma. He also stated that his asthma is under control but his blood sugar levels have been around 150160. ","Physical exam revealed a moderate grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior exams. Mr. Jackson was found to have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow. However, there was no palpable joint effusion and only mild pain was noted with resisted extension of the right wrist. An Xray of the right elbow showed no acute fracture or other bony abnormality, malalignment or joint effusion. ","The doctor diagnosed Mr. Jackson with Acute Lateral Epicondylitis, also known as Tennis Elbow. This was likely a result of increased tennis activity. Despite being on Metformin twice daily, Mr. Jacksons blood sugars were a bit off probably due to his dietary habits. His asthma was under good control. The doctor recommended that Mr. Jackson rest his arm and avoid playing tennis or any repetitive stress on the right arm for four to six weeks. He was advised to ice the elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day. He was to be given a brace for the right forearm to help with the discomfort and was also prescribed Ultram 50mg/day for pain relief. A followup in four weeks was arranged. The doctor increased Mr. Jacksons Metformin dosage to 1000mg twice per day and asked him to check his blood sugar levels twice daily for the next two weeks, and share the readings.

aci-D2N119,"The patient reports suffering from chronic asthma symptoms, including coughing and wheezing. She experiences these symptoms almost every day, with flareups occurring approximately once a month or every other month for the past six months. These episodes often lead to urgent care visits where she receives treatment with either antibiotics or steroids and has even resulted in an emergency room visit. Triggers for asthma flareups include getting sick with a cold and exposure to cats. The patient uses her blue inhaler, possibly Ventolin, every day and on waking up at night due to symptoms. The patient denies any tobacco, marijuana or ecigarette use. She enjoys outdoor activities like hiking, yet has to be mindful of her symptoms. The patient has been hospitalized for her asthma once, as a child. ","The patients vitals reveal a blood pressure of 128 over 82, a respiratory rate of 16, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Listening to the heart, the doctor found a regular rate and rhythm, no ectopic beats, rubs, murmurs, or gallops. However, lung sounds are diminished throughout with occasional slight expiratory wheezing, bilaterally. Neck exam is normal with no lymphadenopathy or carotid bruit. Her hands show strong bilateral pulses, no clubbing, and brisk capillary refill. Pulmonary function test results are consistent with an asthma diagnosis. ","The patient's symptoms indicate a condition of moderate intermittent asthma. The doctor plans to start the patient on Flovent 110 micrograms, one puff twice a day.

aci-D2N120,"The patient, Larry, has been experiencing chronic back pain for a couple of years, which his primary care doctor referred him to address. He describes the pain as a sharp stabbing sensation that sometimes radiates down his right leg to his toe. Larry also suffers from some numbness and tingling, especially down his right leg to his foot. The pain seems to be exacerbated when he sits, and it has affected his ability to remain active and subsequently his weight. He has previously tried physical therapy and prescription pain medications but found no lasting relief. Surgery has been discussed but Larry is not inclined towards it. He was a smoker but quit about twenty years ago. ","During the physical exam, the doctor noticed midline tenderness at the L4 L5 disk space with rightsided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain was observed during lumbar flexion and positive on a supine straight leg test. There was decreased sensation to light touch on the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome, but patellar and Achilles reflexes were symmetrical. MRI results showed disk herniation with nerve impingement. ","The patients symptoms and MRI results are consistent with an L4 L5 herniated disk with radiculopathy. The doctor proposed a treatment plan involving a spinal injection with a corticosteroid under fluoroscopy to the exact area of pain. This would help decrease the inflammation that is causing the pain. The frequency of the injections would be based on the patient's response, not exceeding four times a year. The treatment plan was agreed upon, and an appointment for the first injection was set. "
aci-D2N121,"The patient, Kenneth, reported to have been experiencing pain in his right knee five days prior to the consultation. The pain occurred after a water skiing incident, where he made a jump and landed in a twisted position. He expressed that the knee was fine prior to the incident. The patient stated that he did not hear or feel a pop during the incident, but rather felt like something stretched. The knee swelled afterwards. He managed to get out of the water by himself, though the knee was sore and it is painful when he squats or bends. He also reported that he has been taking Lisinopril 20 milligrams for his high blood pressure and he checks it regularly at home; the record has been stable at 125/80. He also confirmed he is taking overthecounter Aleve twice a day and a cold pack to manage the knee pain. ","The doctor's physical examination revealed ecchymosis and edema on the right knee, with effusion and pain noticeable upon palpation of the right medial knee. Further exam showed decreased range of motion, negative varus and valgus test and negative Lachman sign. Exam also showed the blood pressure of the patient was 120/77 and his heart was maintaining a steady rate and rhythm, with clear lungs upon auscultation. ","Based on the physical examination and the subjective reporting of the patient, the doctor confirmed that the patient's right knee injury is likely a medial collateral ligament strain. Additionally, the patient's hypertension is wellmanaged on his prescribed medication. The doctor proposed to order an xray of the injured knee to verify the initial diagnosis and rule out any broken bones. If the xray result is as expected, the plan is to refer the patient to physical therapy and prescribe Meloxicam 15 mg once a day to reduce the swelling and pain. For the patient's hypertension, the doctor decided to keep the current Lisinopril 20 mg treatment and ordered a lipid panel for further assessment. As the patient is due for a tetanus shot, the doctor decided to provide that as a maintenance. The patient is also advised to avoid any strenuous activities, such as water skiing, until the result of the xray is out. "
aci-D2N122,"The patient, Kyle, visited his PCP after suffering from a cough for about three months. The coughing started after a strenuous day of lifting hay bales for his horses, and then he acquired a cold. His cough has since resolved. His PCP discovered a lung nodule during a chest Xray, which was later confirmed by a CAT scan. Kyle was referred to the current doctor because of this finding. Aside from his cough, Kyle maintains an active lifestyle, which includes frequent biking. Kyle has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, mostly affecting his hands, but it is currently managed with 7.5 mg of methotrexate weekly. He has quit smoking seven years ago, after a history of tobacco use. He denies any familial history of lung cancer but his mother had breast cancer. He denies any history of lung infections or pneumonia. ","The doctor carried out a physical examination. Kyle's vital signs are good, with a blood pressure of 124/76, heart rate of 70, respiration rate of 16, O2 sat on room air at 98%, and no fever. His lungs were clear and equal bilaterally, and his heart exhibited a regular rate and rhythm without any extra beats or abnormal sounds. Kyles skin was described as pink, warm, and dry, with no edema in the lower extremities. There was minor swelling in the knuckles of his third digit on each hand indicative of his rheumatoid arthritis. His pulses and capillary refill were within normal limits. A review of his chest CT scan revealed a solitary 2centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe, and no evidence of any emphysematous disease. ","Kyle has an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule which the doctor plans to have removed via videoassisted thoracostomy. Presurgery, a PET CT will be scheduled to check if the nodule is metabolically active and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) will be carried out to assess baseline lung function. Postsurgery, Kyle will have a chest tube in and will be monitored for one day in the hospital. His rheumatoid arthritis appears to be under control, and he is advised to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist and comply with his current medication regimen with methotrexate. Despite the potential for the lung nodule to be benign, its removal is recommended due to Kyle's history of smoking. "
aci-D2N123,"The patient, Tyler, a 56yearold male with a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure, reported experiencing difficulty swallowing, particularly with solid foods, for the past 45 weeks.

He denied any incident of full choking but expressed worry about potentially choking in the future. He did not note any complimentary symptoms such as coughing, blood in stools, vomiting, weight loss, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Regarding his diabetes, user claimed he is taking his prescribed medication (Metformin 500 mg twice daily), adhering to a better diet and exercise regimen and commonly checks his blood sugar which is within target range. His blood pressure at home was also mostly within normal range. ","Upon physical exam, the doctor noted no abnormalities in the patient's neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, throat, lung, heart, back and extremity. No masses, swelling, or redness was observed in these areas. The doctor detected some epigastric tenderness. The patient's blood pressure was measured in the office as 120/50. ","The doctor's primary concern was a possible narrowing of the patient's throat that might be causing the reported difficulty in swallowing. This may be resulting from a stricture or narrowing of the esophagus. The patient's diabetes seemed under control, based on his own reports and his blood pressure reading was within a normal range. The doctor planned to refer the patient to a gastroenterologist for further investigation of his swallowing issue and recommend initiation of Prilosec 20 mg once daily for possible reflux. The patient was also advised to chew food properly, especially hard foods like steak or meat.

aci-D2N124,"The patient, a 45yearold male named Jerry, reported injuring his ankle while playing basketball with his son. He noticed it was bruised and swollen, particularly on the outside, and expressed discomfort while walking due to feelings of instability. Jerry expressed concern about the injury disrupting his gym workout routine and his upcoming commitment as a volunteer basketball coach starting in April. ","On physical examination, the doctor found exquisite tenderness on the lateral side of the ankle and some tenderness over the medial deltoid region. No skin rupturing was observed. The doctor also noted a brisk capillary refill and no severe malalignment. Upon viewing the Xray, the doctor diagnosed a displaced lateral malleolar fracture at the Weber C level. ","The patient has a lateral malleolar fracture which is causing instability while walking. Due to the location of the fracture, surgical intervention is recommended, involving the placement of plates and screws. This procedure will likely result in Jerry being nonambulatory for approximately three months, leading to the provision of crutches for mobility and the recommendation of coaching duties from the sidelines. In addition, the doctor prescribed meloxicam to help decrease the swelling, and advised regular icing and elevation of the ankle. Jerry mentioned he can do this as he works from home. Lastly, further support and followup will be provided to help manage the patients case and ensure a comprehensive treatment plan. "
aci-D2N125,"The 54yearold male patient, Mr. Edwards, presents with severe, stabbing facial pain focused on the right side of the face. He describes the pain as sometimes feeling excessively hot. He has been experiencing the pain for approximately two to three months and it comes in episodes that can last from few minutes to an hour. Specific triggers include certain temperatures and wind, and overthecounter pain relief medication like ibuprofen and Motrin has been ineffective. The patient says he does not have any numbness or tingling, and maintains face symmetry when showing teeth and performing facial movements. His vision is unaffected. He has a history of occasional headaches but does not suffer from migraines, adverse diseases like multiple sclerosis or brain tumors. His past treatments include selfcare like applying tiger balm and general pain killers but they haven't been effective. He has been referred to the neurosurgeon by his family doctor. ","Upon examination, the physician notes that the patient's facial movements are symmetric and his auditory ability is fine. However, the patient reported feeling numb on his right side when the doctor used cotton tape and distinguished dull feeling on his cheekbone area. By reviewing the patient's MRI, the doctor found that a small blood vessel is potentially pinching the trigeminal nerve. ","Based on the patients symptoms, examination results and the MRI findings, the doctor believes that Mr. Edwards is suffering from trigeminal neuralgia. Treatment will start with prescription medications like Tegretol aiming to reduce the excitability of the nerve and providing potential pain relief. Genetic testing might also be necessary considering Tegretol's potential sideeffects. The doctor plans to see how the patient reacts to this medication. If the medication is ineffective, surgical options may be explored to treat the nerve's compression by the blood vessel. The physician has proposed a followup in one month to check the effectiveness of the drugs. "
