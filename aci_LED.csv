The patient was referred by his primary care physician. He began experiencing back pain after he was moving furniture one weekend ago. He describes his pain as sharp, stabbing pain in his back that goes down to his right leg sometimes all the way to his toe. He also feels that he can not get comfortable when he sits down. Mr. Mitchell reports some numbness and tingling in his right lower extremity, but denies any loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He denies any weakness. He has tried physical therapy before but it is only temporary. When his pain gets really bad, they have had to prescribe strong pain medications for him, which he interprets as temporary. They have also discussed surgery with him in the past, but he would like to avoid surgery. He tries to be as active as he can as much as possible but it has been difficult with his back pain and he has gained some weight over the past years. He used to like to play golf but this has definitely set him back. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Musculoskeletal: No overlying erythema. Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: No redness or ecchymosis. Tenderness at L4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbal paravertebral tenderness. Neurological: Decreased sensation to the right lateral thigh at l4. Light touch at the right medial thigh atL4.

PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that the typical approach to a breast reduction is to document her symptoms, symptoms, and pictures, and then they will be submitted to the insurance company for review and possible approval. We discussed that typically, we will take pictures of the breast, elevate the nipple position, and remove any extra fat and breash breast tissue, so that the breast will become smaller in size. She was advised that approximately 30% of the patients can not breastfeed after the reduction. We also discussed that the breasts will enlarge, especially if she can breastfeed. I advised her that after she has children, her breasts will also enlarge and appear deflated. She will have some activity restrictions for about 6 weeks after surgery, including no heavy lifting. I also advised her to avoid driving for 2 to 3 weeks. The drains stay in for about a week. At this point, she has not met with anyone prior to this consult, but I believe she is a good candidate for this procedure and I think she will benefit from it as well. I recommend that we proceed with the breast reduction as soon as her insurance is switched over. We will submit the documentation to the Insurance company in the form of a referral to a new provider, and once that is completed, the patient will be able to follow up with me again right before the surgery to discuss any last minute questions.

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her ecG taken today revealed atrialFibrillation but without any obvious signs of acute coronary syndrome. We discussed that this is not uncommon and that many people with a atrialfib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes. I advised her to continue with her current medication regimen. She should continue to be active and I encouraged her to follow up in 6 to 9 months. All questions were answered. The patient will follow up with me in 69 months. "

virtscribe-D2N105,"CHIEF COMPLAINT Heart murmur. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for a new patient note. The patient was referred to me by her primary care physician. She presents today due to a murmur in her heart. This has been going on for approximately 6 months. She is not sure what symptoms she should be having; however, she feels overly tired due to taking all her medication. She also experiences shortness of breath if she walks too fast or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. She denies any chest pain or dyspnea on exertion. Ms. Scott does report taking pain pills for her legs. She does note that she has lost a little weight, but she still weighs about 120 pounds. Her weight has been trending down for about a year. She no longer moves as fast as she used to. She endorses no fevers, chills, or passing out. The only complaint she has is severe leg pain, which she has been experiencing for about 1 month. Her legs have been severe for about 0.5 months. she denies any swelling in her ankles. She has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. However, her s2 is relatively preserved, which would be more consistent with moderate. Some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction. Her echocardiogram today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs, as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern. she does not have any significant palpitations. PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her echOCardiogram will help to assess her overall cardiac structure and function, aswell as the valve view where diseased. We discussed that if her symptoms are severe, we may need to consider an ischemic evaluation or a heart mon- monitor to assess the overall burden of the Pvcs. Given her age and no history of coronary artery D- artery disease, it is possible that she might be able to stop her statin. I recommended that she continue taking amlodipine and lisinopril as they are currently. Regarding her hyperthyroidism, she can continue taking levothyroxine as they were currently. We will see her back here in 3 or 4 weeks to discuss the results and her next steps. All questions were answered. INSTRUCTIONS The patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks.","Heart murmur.
