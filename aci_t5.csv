aci-D2N106," The patient is a hunter and he lives in the city about two years ago and he has a large plot of land where he has venison. He wants to share it with me. He has noticed that he is catching his breath a lot more than he used to and he thinks that is probably due to allergies because he has a dog that has eyebugers and he has noticed that he has watery eyes and he thinks that the allergies are probably because he has a dog that has eyebugers. He has noticed that he is catching his breath a lot more than he used to and he thinks that it is mostly because he has a dog that has eyebugers and he has noticed that the symptoms come on when he is near his cat, outside the house, when the cat is not around, and in the house when the cat is not around as well. He has noticed that he is catching his breath a lot more than he used to and he thinks that is probably because he has a dog that has eyebugers and he went to the urgent care and they gave him a nebulizer that helped and they prescribed him an inhaler that he uses now when he feels the symptoms coming on. He does not appreciate any rash on his body, no angioedema, no angioedema of the lips, no audible stridor, no faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields, chest x-ray, pulmonary function test were both normal.

aci-D2N107," The patient was raking leaves yesterday and felt fine until about two hours later when she started having pain and pins and needles in her right foot. She had been raking leaves yesterday and felt fine then when she got into her house about two hours later her back started tightening up and she started getting pins and needles in her right foot. She had had this type of pain in the past about three years ago and it went away after a day. She tried ice, two advils, and it didn't help. She thought the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it felt a little better when she was sitting. She said she normally does not do any physical activity. She said her husband does all the yard work as well. I was able to get a good impression of her back and it seems like she may have sprained her low back. I want to rest it, I'm going to prescribe some meloxicam, I have not taken that before and I'm going to prescribe some physical therapy as well because she said she has not been overly active and her partner has been reporting the same thing for a long time and she thinks they could get her into some physical therapy and hopefully get her back back in shape and she could do some stretches and some exercises and then if it is still not improving I want her to send me a message and we can possibly look into getting her an MRI if it is still not improving."
aci-D2N108," The patient is here today with a nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer. He has had it for about two months now and it has recently become red and draining. He is concerned about how it is healing. He thinks that it may have been from walking barefoot on the beach. He did see his primary care physician before he came in and they did put him on antibiotics. He does not remember the name of the medication they gave him. He was at dewey beach in an ambulance when he hurt his foot. He does not have specific pain but he does have some throbbing. He thinks that is probably the major cause of the nonhealing ulcer. He takes his medication but does not check his blood sugars all the time. He does not really know how well his diabetes is controlled. He thinks that his last a1c is around 10 or so. He does not really know how well his diabetes is controlled. He does not really check his blood sugars all the time. He thinks that his last a1c is around 10 or so.

I did a quick physical exam of his foot and on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, just proximal to the fifth mtp joint, there is some redness, some drainage present, edema around it, there is some fluid like you said that is coming out of it, he does not see any necrosis, he does not have any odor and he does not appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it is red, it is swollen, he thinks that he has an infection in there as well. When he touches it, he feels some increased pressure but he does not have any specific pain. He thinks that it is probably from an infection.

aci-D2N110," The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of diabetes who presented to the office with a sore on his right foot that is not healing. He has had it for about two to three weeks and has been seen by his pcp and they referred him to you. He used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago they moved and he was unable to get another one. He has had the wound on his right foot for about two to three weeks and he has not been getting better. He has had no trauma to the foot. He has been wearing a new pair of hoka's shoes and the neuropathy he has had some time ago was just a blister but it has gotten worse now he has been putting a band-aid on it and he finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same. He has not had any fever, chills, drainage from the wound or anything along those lines. When he takes his sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when he puts a band-aid on it. He is upset with the shoes he is wearing. He is not wearing the same shoes that cause the problem. He has been wearing hoka's. He got them at rei a couple of years ago. They are very good about helping him to fit in the shoe. They provide good stability. He has had some problems with stability with the shoes. He does not think it is too bad his diabetes because his last hgb a1c was a little over 8 and he does not think it is too bad his blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound i will also want to perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i will prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and he will wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area. I don't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see him again in two weeks and if the abi indicates his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing then we may need to refer him to a vascular specialist. I will see him again in two weeks and if the abi indicates his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing then we may need to refer him to a vascular specialist."

I want to talk about getting his knee fixed up. I also want to talk about some of the other problems that he has. I know that he has hypertension and I discussed maybe he could get a blood pressure cuff because I wanted him to measure those a bit more regularly. He does not have a blood pressure cuff and he does not think that he has been measuring those a bit more regularly. He is on 20 mg of lisinopril most days and he is not suspicious but we are just gon na go with that because looking at his vitals it is still a little high and he is not really comfortable with it seeing like a hundred and 80 over 80 and he does not really feel that we wan na be able to get his medication adjusted. He has a problem with diabetes and his blood sugars seem to be a little bit better and he thinks that he is taking his metformin 500 mg most days and he does not think that he is on a keto diet and he does not seem to be particularly focused on his carbs.

aci-D2N121," The patient is a patient of mine and I am going to go over some of my clinical findings and plan for his knee pain. I think for the first problem, he has what I call a medial collateral ligament strain. I will order an x-ray of his right knee just to make sure that we are not missing any broken bones which I don't think we are. The good thing about this is that people usually heal quite well from this and they don't need surgery we can just refer him to physical therapy to strengthen those muscles around his knee so that he doesn't have any more injury and I will prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day to help with some of the pain and it only has to be taken once a day and it doesn't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that. I think for the second problem, he has hypertension. I will continue on lisinopril 20 mg a day. I will just order an lipid panel to make sure that everything is okay from that standpoint and then he is going to get a tetanus shot for health maintenance."
