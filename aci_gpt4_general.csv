aci-D2N106,"The patient, Charles, reports to the doctor that he is experiencing shortness of breath more frequently than usual and his eyes water too, which he suspects could be due to allergies. An urgent care visit had previously provided him with a nebulizer for relief and he has been prescribed an inhaler to use when he feels symptoms coming on. In addition to this, Charles mentions frequent diarrhea after heavy drinking.

The doctor conducts a physical examination noting that while Charles' vital signs look good, there is faint expiratory wheezing in all lung fields. However, a previous chest X-ray and pulmonary function test came back normal.

The doctor diagnoses Charles with newly diagnosed allergic asthma and advises him to continue using the albuterol inhaler at the onset of any symptoms. She prescribes an additional medication called Singulair to help decrease the frequency of his asthma incidents.

The doctor also decides to proceed with allergy testing starting with skin testing to identify possible triggers and hopefully avoid further management. If this proves unsuccessful, they will consider more testing and possible immunotherapy.

The doctor schedules a follow up with Charles the following week to conduct the skin testing. She instructed Charles to bring his cats to the next appointment."
aci-D2N107,"Bryan, the patient, reported experiencing back pain and a pins-and-needles sensation in his right foot after raking leaves. He had a similar but less severe incident three years ago that resolved without intervention. Home remedies such as applying ice and taking Advil didn't provide any relief. His pain eased a bit with a hot shower and sitting down, though his partner noted he seemed to experience more discomfort standing up than Bryan reported. Bryan reported pain when bending over, standing up, and when the doctor applied pressure around his L5 vertebra. 

The patient doesn't generally engage in physical activity. Apart from back pain, the patient's right leg also had a tingling sensation. Bryan's dorsiflexion was regular, and pulses were equal in all extremities. An x-ray of his lower back showed nothing abnormal.

The doctor diagnosed a probable lower back sprain and prescribed rest, Meloxicam (a new medication for Bryan), and physical therapy. If Bryan's condition doesn't improve, the doctor suggested the possibility of further investigation, potentially through an MRI. Bryan's partner expressed concern about the level of pain and pushed for an immediate MRI, but the doctor recommended observing the situation for two more weeks before taking that step."
aci-D2N108,"Patient Gregory has had a nonhealing foot ulcer for two months now that recently turned red and started draining. He does not recall any specific trauma that caused it, but thinks it might have originated from walking barefoot on a beach. He had seen his primary care provider (PCP), who had started him on antibiotics, although he couldn't recall the name and hadn't picked them up from the pharmacy yet. The patient also mentioned occasional throbbing pain.

In addition, Gregory has diabetes, for which he takes medication. However, he confessed not checking his blood sugar levels regularly and not being sure how to do so either. His last recorded A1C level was around ten, which the doctor informed him is high.

Upon physically examining the patient, the doctor found a 1x2 inch circular wound on the lateral side of Gregory's right foot, exhibiting redness, drainage, and surrounding edema. However, there was no necrosis, foul odor, or bony exposure. The patient did not feel pain when the area was touched, just an increase in pressure.

An X-ray of Gregory's foot did not show any evidence of osteomyelitis, suggesting the infection is limited to his skin. As part of the treatment plan, the doctor ordered an ankle-brachial index (ABI) to assess the blood supply in Gregory's foot, performed a debridement to remove dead tissue, and prescribed Clindamycin (400mg, twice a day for seven days) to address the ongoing infection. The patient was also provided with a surgical shoe to reduce irritation from footwear and advised to return for a follow-up in two weeks.

The patient was instructed to reach out to the office or go to an urgent care or ER in case of any worsening symptoms or emergence of a fever. The doctor reminded Gregory to prioritize controlling his diabetes due to its likely impact on his foot's healing process."
aci-D2N109,"Stephanie Morales is a 36-year-old female with a history of diabetes and high blood pressure. She presented with pain in her left ankle, secondary to a fall on ice two days prior. The fall resulted in her ankle twisting under her body, causing it to swell, making walking difficult. The pain is mostly located on the outside of the ankle. Stephanie has treated the pain and swelling with ibuprofen, ice, and elevation, which provided some relief. 

Regarding her chronic medical history, Stephanie is managing her diabetes well with a stable diet and regular blood sugar checks. Her hemoglobin A1C level was recently 6.8 and she has an eye exam, related to her diabetes, scheduled in the next few weeks. Stephanie also requires a refill of her blood pressure medication, Norvasc.

The doctor performed a physical exam during the visit and found tenderness over her left ankle's lateral malleolus and fifth metatarsal, with some swelling and redness. The rest of her physical exam, including her neck, lungs, heart, and belly, was normal, except for a consistent 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

The primary concern is an ankle sprain, but due to the location of the tenderness an X-ray was ordered to rule out a fracture. In the meantime, Stephanie was given an air splint for her ankle, along with crutches, and advised no weight-bearing on the affected foot. The doctor prescribed Naprosyn for pain control and instructed Stephanie to elevate her foot and use ice. The plan will be adjusted based on the results of the X-ray.

Stephanie is also advised to continue monitoring her blood sugar levels and maintaining her diabetes diet. The doctor will order another hemoglobin A1C test and refill her Norvasc prescription for high blood pressure. Stephanie has been doing a good job managing her chronic conditions and is advised to closely monitor any changes. If anything shifts, she is to call the doctor immediately."
aci-D2N110,"Patient Wayne has a non-healing sore on his right foot, which has been present for two to three weeks. The wound was initially a blister caused by a tight shoe, but it worsened. He previously saw a podiatrist and was referred to the current doctor by his primary care physician (PCP). Wayne finished a course of antibiotics recently, but the wound looks the same and, due to neuropathy, he doesn't feel any pain. He reports no fever, chills or drainage from the wound, but his socks sometimes stick to it. He has stopped wearing the shoes that caused the blister.

The patient has diabetes, with his last Hb1Ac being over eight. A physical exam revealed a 1x2 inch circular wound on Wayne's right foot with some yellow slough and minimal granulation tissue, but no erythema, cellulitis, fluid collection, necrosis, odor, or bony exposure. His x-ray showed no evidence of osteomyelitis (bone infection). 

The doctor's plan includes ordering an ankle-brachial index (ABI) to assess the blood supply to Wayne's foot, debriding the wound in the office, and prescribing collagenase ointment for daily application plus a dry sterile dressing. He prescribed a surgical shoe to alleviate pressure on the area. The doctor plans to see Wayne in two weeks and may refer him to a vascular specialist if blood supply to the wound is not optimal. No further antibiotics are suggested. 

The doctor stressed the importance of controlling Wayne's diabetes to help the wound heal and mentioned a possible consultation with a diabetes specialist to review potential diet modifications that could improve his HbA1C levels."
aci-D2N111,"Patient William injured his right knee while visiting a trampoline park for the first time. He experienced a snap and instant pain, particularly on the outside (or lateral) aspect of his knee. He took Tylenol for the pain, but it was not very effective. The injury occurred one week prior to the doctor's visit. He has a hypertension condition and is prescribed 20mg of Lisinopril, but he has not consistently checked his blood pressure nor has he always remembered to take his medication. His blood pressure at the appointment was high. He also has diabetes and is on 500mg of metformin. He measures his blood sugar 4-5 times per week and believes it has been a bit better. He just tried to watch what he eats but does not follow a specific diet or count calories.

Upon examination, the doctor noted bruising and swelling on the outside of the patient's knee. Despite pain, William has a decent range of motion and was able to walk with a slight limp. An X-ray showed no fracture or bony abnormality. The doctor diagnosed a lateral ligament strain and prescribed 15mg of Meloxicam daily for pain and swelling. He also referred the patient to physical therapy.

For hypertension, the doctor planned to continue the Lisinopril prescription but also considered possible medication adjustments due to persistently high blood pressure. For diabetes, an A1C and a lipid panel were ordered to get a clearer understanding of the patient's long-term blood sugar levels and potential adjustments to medication."
aci-D2N112,"Matthew, a patient, has been experiencing back pain, which has worsened over the past month. The pain radiates from his lower back through his left hip and down his leg, being described like an ""electrical toothache"". His situation can get so bad where he rates the pain as 13/10. Lying down seems to give him relief while standing, walking, coughing, and sneezing aggravates the discomfort. Consequently, his mobility is affected to the point where he is often bed-ridden, had to use a cane, and finds his legs to be weak. He had mentioned a fall from a roof 30 years ago, which was thought to have possibly fractured something causing him back issues since.

Upon further examination, the doctor identified it to be positive for pain when palpating the L4 vertebrae and found difficulties with flexion and extension of Matthew's back. His leg strength was produced a score of 4/5 for the left and 5/5 for the right, while he had no issues with reflexes, motor and sensory capabilities in both lower extremities.

Matthew's MRI showed a disc herniation at the L4 L5 vertebrae level along with nerve root impingement, meaning there's compression caused by the herniation resulting in his pain. His doctor recommended an epidural steroid injection to soothe the inflammation and referred him back to physical therapy (PT) to strengthen the area. The doctor plans to reassess Matthew's condition in a month.
"
aci-D2N113,"Patient Jacqueline had a regular check up with her doctor, where she expressed her concern about recent blood work indicating she had Hepatitis C, despite not having any associated symptoms. She reported a history of intravenous (IV) drug use over 15 years ago, current moderate alcohol consumption (approximately a beer a day and possibly slightly more on the weekends), and smoking one to two cigarettes a day. She does not have any other known medical conditions, but mentioned feeling more tired than usual after her work day despite good sleep. The patient has a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and depression.

On physical examination, the doctor did not note any signs of distress or physical abnormalities, including no jaundice, clear lung sounds, no noticeable enlargement of the liver or spleen, and no apparent gait disturbance or edema. The patient does have a 2 out of 6 systolic murmur, but this is unchanged from the previous year.

Additional blood work showed that Jacqueline's Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test was positive and her liver panel indicated an elevated Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) at 39, but all other liver-related tests, including Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, and total bilirubin, were within normal limits.

The doctor plans to confirm the Hepatitis C diagnosis with further blood work, including checking the Hepatitis C RNA and genotype. The severity of Jacqueline's liver disease will also be determined through a special ultrasound to check for fibrosis of the liver. The doctor has scheduled a follow-up appointment in three weeks and advised Jacqueline to get her family tested for Hepatitis C as well.

No issues or changes regarding medication or overall health condition have been reported by the patient."
aci-D2N114,"The patient has been experiencing frequent and severe headaches for multiple years, which have increased recently. The headaches are localized mostly on the right side and behind the eye with pulsing sensations. Notably, they become significantly worse when she tries to exercise. Additionally, she has been suffering from ringing in her ears and intermittent blurred vision, predominantly on one side. However, she does not experience any numbness or tingling in her limbs or face.

These concerning symptoms led to a referral to the specialist in this dialogue. The doctor checked her vitals, which were normal, and performed a physical exam, including a neurological examination. Everything was generally normal apart from the discovery of papilledema, a swelling behind the eye. 

The doctor suspects the patient might be suffering from idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This condition can cause increased pressure in the brain, leading to symptoms like headaches, ringing in the ears, and changes in vision. To confirm this diagnosis, the patient needs an MRI to rule out other possibilities and a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. She should also undergo an eye exam conducted by a neuro-ophthalmologist. The plan for treatment, provided the diagnosis is confirmed, would include medication to decrease the pressure in the brain, alongside an exercise regimen and weight loss."
aci-D2N115,"Patient Jack was in a car accident about a week ago that resulted in his neck moving forward violently, causing him consistent pain in the back of his neck. He rates the pain as a seven out of ten, it worsens when he moves his neck and is marginally alleviated with ibuprofen, with the pain reducing to a five out of ten. He is mostly able to turn his neck from side to side, though it causes him pain. The pain however does not extend to his upper back or shoulder, and is limited to his neck. Jack has not experienced any hearing problems or visual disturbances since the accident. He used to play football, but did not experience any neck issues at that time. He did not visit the emergency room after the accident due to cost concerns and is unaware of any swelling or bruising on his neck.

The doctor conducted a physical examination, during which the patient experienced pain when pressure was applied to the side of his neck, when he flexed his neck and touched his chin to his chest, when he moved his neck back, and when he turned his head side to side.

The x-ray results did not show any signs of fracture or bony abnormalities. The doctor diagnosed him with neck strain. He has prescribed anti-inflammatory medication (Motrin, 600mg, every six to eight hours) and a muscle relaxant (Flexeril, 10mg, every twelve hours as needed). The doctor has advised the patient to avoid straining his neck and ordered an MRI for a more detailed investigation. The patient has been referred for either physical rehab or chiropractic care pending the results of the MRI. The doctor suspects the patient may be suffering from whiplash."
aci-D2N116,"Bobby visited the doctor due to lingering pain in his right shoulder, which he attributes to recent heavy yard work and a prior baseball injury from his youth. The pain tends to intensify with movement and during the night. Over-the-counter medication such as Advil and cold compressions provide some temporary relief. He has good arm mobility and no numbness, but there is focused soreness on the outside of his shoulder which becomes prominent when raising his arm. The doctor conducted a physical examination, including reviewing his vitals, and noted tenderness at the tuberosity of the humerus, but not at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. An x-ray was performed revealing no fracture. The doctor concluded that the likely cause is rotator cuff tendinopathy, and advised an MRI and physical therapy for 6-8 weeks. If symptoms persist, steroid injections could be considered. Bobby also mentioned soreness in his feet and ankles from extended periods of yard work, which he currently manages by elevating his feet and applying ice. The doctor suggested soaking his feet in Epsom salts to alleviate the discomfort."
aci-D2N117,"Patient Information/Chief Complaint: Mr. Jackson, a 45-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes and mild intermittent asthma presents with right elbow pain. Mr. Jackson has been playing a lot of tennis recently which he suspects might be the cause of his elbow pain, which has been ongoing for about three weeks.

Summary of Encounter: The patient characterizes the pain in his right elbow as severe (8/10) when in use, and mild to moderate (3/10) while at rest. The pain is located on the outer part of the elbow and does not radiate. The pain is described as shooting, stabbing, and very sharp. He has not had any recent trauma or accidents. He has tried pain relief methods such as Tylenol, Ibuprofen, and ice, but the relief is temporary and minimal.

Examination Findings: Physical examination revealed moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and moderate pain with passive range of motion. There was also mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist. No palpable joint effusion was observed. An X-ray of the right elbow showed no acute fracture or other bony abnormality and no malalignment or sign of joint effusion. He also has a grade 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur which is unchanged from prior exam. 

Review of Current Medications/Conditions: His asthma is under control. The patient reports blood sugar levels of around 150-160. He is currently taking Metformin 500mg twice a day. He is allergic to penicillin, and had his gallbladder removed ten years ago.

Plan: The patient was diagnosed with acute lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, likely due to excessive tennis activity. The recommended treatment plan is to rest the right arm, stop playing tennis for 4-6 weeks, and avoid repetitive stress on the right arm. Additionally, icing the right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day was advised to reduce pain and inflammation. A brace will be provided for the right forearm. A prescription for Ultram 50mg once per day was written to help manage the pain.

In relation to his diabetes, his Metformin dosage was increased to 1000mg twice daily, and he was asked to monitor his blood sugar levels twice daily. Blood tests including a hemoglobin A1C level, CBC, and chem-12 were also ordered. 

His asthma medication (Flovent and Albuterol) regimen was reviewed and deemed satisfactory, with a prescription refill for Albuterol provided. 

The patient was asked to return for a follow-up in four weeks.
"
aci-D2N118,"The patient, Angela, visited the doctor due to pain from a kidney stone. She had also experienced kidney stones multiple times in the past, this being her seventh or eighth occurrence. She went to the emergency room a week prior to her current appointment due to pain, but believes she passed the stone three days prior to the visit as her pain was no longer present and she no longer noticed blood in her urine. The doctor plans to refer her to a urologist and requested labs for her kidney function. 

Angela suffers from hypertension and diabetes alongside recurring kidney stones. Although the doctor found Angela's blood pressure was high during her visit, she shares her readings at home are typically within normal range, suggesting she may have ""white coat syndrome."" She is currently taking 2.5 of Norvasc to manage her hypertension and maintaining a fair diet. The doctor will continue her on the same dosage of Norvasc but requested a consult to nutrition to enhance her diet quality and offer assistance with managing her eating habits.

In regard to her diabetes, Angela is prescribed a daily dosage of 500 milligrams of Metformin. She acknowledges not frequently testing her blood sugar but believes they have been within normal range. However, her A1C was 6.7 at the last visit, which shows an improvement from her initial diagnosis. The doctor advised her to continue with her current prescription and also to monitor her blood sugar before meals to maintain her progress. 

Apart from her chronic conditions, Angela had previously mentioned insomnia. While she hasn't found great improvements through the use of treatment methods such as meditation apps or melatonin, she prefers not to use sleeping pills. The doctor advised her to continue with 10 milligrams of Melatonin when needed and to further practice good sleep hygiene.

In summary, the doctor's visit centered on monitoring and improving Angela's kidney health, hypertension, diabetes, and insomnia. She will follow up with her doctor in three months."
aci-D2N119,"The patient, Betty, has a long history of asthma which has been causing her frequent coughing and wheezing symptoms. She has observed that her asthma flares and exacerbates when she gets a cold or in the presence of her aunt's cat. The incidents of these breathing difficulties have been reported to occur approximately every month or every other month continuously for the past six months. The severity of these events has often required her to seek treatment from Urgent Care providers or her primary care physician. 

Her treatment usually involves prescription antibiotics, and occasionally, steroid medication. In extreme cases, such as a severe asthma flare-up, she has had to seek immediate help from the Emergency Department. Betty uses two different inhalers, preferring the blue one, Ventolin (also known as Albuterol), which she confirms works better for her. She uses this inhaler almost daily and sometimes during the night to manage her coughing and wheezing symptoms, usually taking two puffs. 

She has been hospitalized just once due to her asthma when she was around eight years old. Some of the frequent visits to the ER and Urgent Care in the past year have involved treatments with Prednisone, either as a large dose over five days or in reduced amounts over nine or ten days. Her last exacerbation was about a month ago. Besides the response to her aunt's cat, Betty has no known issues of seasonal allergies and enjoys outdoor activities like hiking. Betty maintains a lifestyle free from smoking cigarettes, vaping, and marijuana use. 

Upon physical examination, the doctor assessed her body vitals including blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, lung sounds, and checked her neck and hands. The results of the pulmonary function test indicated a diagnosis of asthma. 

Given the frequency and intensity of her symptoms, the doctor classified Betty's asthma as moderate intermittent. As part of the treatment plan, the doctor emphasized the importance of using her prescribed inhaled steroid inhaler consistently which should help reduce everyday symptoms and lessen the need to use her rescue inhaler, Albuterol, as frequently. The patient was informed to continue using the Ventolin inhaler during acute breathing issues and to wait and gauge her breathing before taking additional puffs. An asthma action plan will be developed for her that could help manage her symptoms. 

The doctor also prescribed Flovent, 110 micrograms, to be taken twice daily, and advised the patient to continue using Ventolin with two puffs every 4-6 hours as needed. The doctor scheduled a follow-up appointment in one month or sooner if her symptoms worsen."
aci-D2N120,"Larry, the patient, visited a doctor due to chronic back pain which he has been experiencing for a couple of years. The pain began after moving furniture one weekend, and no significant accident or fall is associated with it. He describes it as a sharp stabbing pain that extends from his back down to his right leg and even his big toe at times. He also experiences discomfort that worsens when he sits down, along with numbness and tingling in his right leg down to his foot. There is no loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area, no weakness, and no loss of control of his bladder or bowels.

Previously, Larry has tried physical therapy and has been prescribed strong pain medication. He was once suggested surgery, but he wishes to avoid it. Due to his pain, his daily activities have been affected, and he has gained weight over the years. He was starting to enjoy playing golf, but the pain has hindered his progress.

The doctor confirmed Larry quit smoking about twenty years ago and found no family history of spine conditions. Larry was subjected to a quick physical examination which showed overall normal vitals. His musculoskeletal back exam revealed midline tenderness at the L4 L5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness.

MRI results indicated disc herniation with nerve impingement. The radiographic and physical findings alongside his reported symptoms suggest Larry has a chronic lumbar back pain stemming from an L4 L5 herniated disk with radiculopathy. To alleviate inflammation causing the pain, the doctor recommended a spinal injection of a corticosteroid into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy, which Larry agreed to consider.
"
aci-D2N121,"Patient Kenneth visited the doctor with pain in his right knee, resulting from a water skiing incident about five days ago. Kenneth twisted his knee while landing a jump, and though he didn't hear or feel anything pop, the knee felt sore and swelled up. He was able to exit the water without help, but noted difficulty and pain while squatting or bending. This was the first time he had injured his knee.

In addition to the knee pain, the patient is being treated for high blood pressure. He takes 20mg of Lisinopril daily, checking his blood pressure at home and reporting an average reading of about 125 over 80. No side effects have been noted.

He does not experience any numbness or tingling in his foot from the knee pain, but describes persistent pain and swelling. For the pain, he's been using over-the-counter Aleve twice a day, along with cold packs, which have helped moderately.

The patient's medical history includes a tonsillectomy and he has been managing his high blood pressure well based on measured vitals at the doctor’s office.

Upon physical examination, the doctor identified an effusion (swelling), ecchymosis (bruise), and pain along the medial (inner) side of the right knee. The doctor mentioned a decreased range of motion and a negative Lachman test.

The doctor diagnosed him with a strain to the Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) of his right knee and has ordered an x-ray to rule out any broken bones. Treatment plan includes a physical therapy referral and prescription for Meloxicam (15mg/day) to reduce swelling and pain. The doctor cautioned on further activity like skiing to avoid compounding injury until the results of the x-ray are out.

The patient's high blood pressure is being managed with the continuation of Lisinopril. A lipid panel test was recommended. Also, since the patient is due for a tetanus shot, one was also administered.
"
aci-D2N122,"Patient Kyle visited the doctor after being diagnosed with bronchitis and a lung nodule by his primary care physician. He underwent a chest x-ray and a CT scan that confirmed the nodule's presence. Kyle has had a persistent cough that he noticed about three months prior when he was loading hay for his horses, but the cough has since dissipated. 

Kyle has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, currently managing it with a weekly dose of 7.5 milligrams methotrexate. He used to smoke but quit about seven years ago. He exercises regularly by biking but expressed no instances of pain or shortness of breath. He has no known history of lung infections or pneumonia, and the only known familial history of cancer is his mother's breast cancer.

Upon physical examination, the doctor found normal vital signs and healthy lung and heart sounds. Some swelling was noted on the patient's third digit on both hands, typical for rheumatoid arthritis.

The results from the chest CT scan confirm a solitary two-centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe of the lung. There were no signs of emphysematous disease.

The doctor suggested a two-fold treatment plan. For the lung nodule, a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) and PET CT are to be scheduled. The nodule is planned to be removed via video-assisted thoracoscopy; this operation involves three small incisions on the right side of the chest and is scheduled to take about an hour and a half under general anesthesia. He will be hospitalized overnight with a chest tube that will be removed the next day. For the rheumatoid arthritis, the doctor recommended continuing the current medication plan and follow-ups with his rheumatologist. The doctor acknowledged the patient's anxiety and ensured him of continual support throughout this process."
aci-D2N123,"Tyler, a 56-year-old male with medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure, has been experiencing difficulty swallowing for the past 4-5 weeks. He feels like something is stuck in his throat, especially when eating solid food, but he has no coughing and no issues swallowing liquids. There are no notable symptoms such as blood in stool or vomit, undesired weight loss, chest pain or shortness of breath. The doctor plans to refer Tyler to a specialist to investigate the cause of his swallowing difficulty.

Regarding the management of his diabetes with Metformin 500mg twice daily, Tyler reports taking his medication as prescribed and feeling good generally. He checks his blood sugar levels regularly and reports they are within targeted range. He reported no side effects from the medication. His last Hemoglobin A1c was 7.4. The doctor plans to repeat this test and anticipates improvement based on Tyler’s good adherence to his treatment regimen and a healthy diet.

Tyler's blood pressure is currently managed with Norvasc. His blood pressure measurement in the clinic was fine (120/50) and at home, it's either within or close to the target range.

Upon examination, no abnormal findings were detected in his neck, throat, lung, heart, belly, back, extremities or neurological status; however, the doctor suspected esophageal stricture. The doctor will refer him to a gastroenterologist for a scope, and start him on Prilosec 20mg once daily.

Tyler also needs a refill of his Norvasc prescription, which doctor agreed to provide. Furthermore, the doctor is referring Tyler to an ophthalmologist for eye health evaluation. He is expected to return for a follow-up in a month after getting blood work done.
"
aci-D2N124,"Jerry, a 45-year-old male, visited the doctor for an ankle injury he got while playing basketball with his son. He described landing awkwardly, rolling and twisting his ankle, leading to pain, bruising, and swelling on the outside. He experienced difficulty walking and lack of stability in the ankle, which was disrupting his recent return to regular gym workouts.

Upon physical examination, the doctor observed swelling on the lateral side of Jerry's ankle, tenderness in both the lateral and medial deltoid region, intact skin, brisk capillary refill, and no horrible malalignment. However, Jerry had trouble standing on it and experienced pain and instability while walking.

An X-ray was performed, revealing a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level. There was no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures. Jerry was diagnosed with a lateral malleolar fracture, which was causing the instability. The doctor recommended surgery involving the placement of a plate and screws to heal the fracture, followed by a recovery period of approximately three months off the feet.

In the interim, the doctor prescribed Meloxicam to manage swelling and pain, and advised Jerry to ice his ankle and keep it elevated. Jerry confirmed he would be able to do this as he works from home. He did express concern about not being able to walk his dogs during his recovery but concluded he would figure out a solution for that."
aci-D2N125,"Miss Edwards, a 54-year-old male, came in for evaluation due to facial pain he had been experiencing for two to three months. The pain was described as stabbing, shooting, and sometimes accompanied by heat. The pain was localized to the right cheekbone area and occasionally triggered by certain temperatures or wind. Attempts at self-treatment with ibuprofen, Motrin, and Tiger Balm were unsuccessful.

Apart from this, he didn't notice any numbness, tingling, weakness, or change in vision on that side. He also doesn't have a history of migraines or any brain-related conditions. Routine headaches were managed with Tylenol. The patient rated the pain as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 and stated the pain episodes could last a few minutes to an hour.

Upon physical examination, the patient had a sensation of numbness and dullness on the right side of the face. After reviewing the patient's MRI, the doctor found a small blood vessel abutting and possibly compressing the trigeminal nerve. Based on these findings, the doctor diagnosed Miss Edwards with trigeminal neuralgia.

The doctor recommended starting on medications, with Tegretol being the initial choice. The patient was informed of the potential side effects, including memory loss, tingling, imbalance, and potential skin reactions. The doctor also suggested genetic testing. If medication doesn't prove effective, discussion of surgical options to treat the pain was put forth. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in a month once the medication's effect could be evaluated."
aci-D2N126,"The patient, Michelle, injured her right knee while skiing in Vermont. She was unable to bear weight on her right leg after the fall and had to be taken down by ski patrol. Ever since the incident, she reports experiencing persistent pain, particularly on the outside of her knee, and is unable to fully bend or straighten the joint. She also mentioned feeling like her knee might buckle under her weight.

The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes and confirms she is able to feel them normally. She lives with her husband, who often has to work, and her twin four-year-old children. At the time of consultation, she was using crutches for mobility support. Michelle denied having any significant past medical history, including high blood pressure or diabetes. She generally leads an active lifestyle and would like to return to running eventually.

Upon physical examination, the doctor noticed edema and an effusion over the right knee, reduced movement, and a positive Lachman sign. The patient reported pain when pressure was applied to the lateral aspect of her knee. There was no swelling in her ankle and her heart and lungs appeared normal.

The doctor suggested that Michelle might have ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), despite the absence of any bony abnormalities in the initial X-ray of the knee. To confirm this, the doctor ordered an MRI scan. The doctor has also decided to provide a knee brace for support and advised Michelle to continue her current pain management regime of ibuprofen every eight hours as necessary. Further plans and possible treatments, including potentially using a graft for ACL repair, will be discussed once the results of the MRI are available."
aci-D2N127,"Brandon, the patient, visited the doctor complaining of intense neck pain rated as a twelve on a ten-point scale. He revealed that he has been involved in multiple car crashes, the most recent one happening in February. This recent crash has resulted in severe pain that has rendered him unable to work.

Brandon disclosed that he has a history of therapy and surgery due to previous crashes. He has been on prescription medication, specifically Fentanyl, which he hasn't received in several weeks. He currently experiences sharp, incapacitating neck pain, headaches, and occasional dizziness. He also suffers from numbness in his left arm and right leg, and body spasms. He also complains of occasional bruising and fatigue since the most recent crash.

Upon examining Brandon, the doctor found pain upon palpation on the neck, limited range of movement, and pain when the neck is bent forward or backward. However, there was no visual evidence of bruising, swelling, or lacerations in the current visit.

A previous X-ray before the checkup revealed no fractures; hence, the doctor diagnosed Brandon with a neck sprain. To provide a thorough confirmation, an MRI was planned. The doctor also prescribed Robaxin (1500 mg every six to eight hours) to relax the muscles and address the pain, noting that Fentanyl was a more severe treatment. 

The doctor also recommended local injections to alleviate the pain if the Robaxin was not effective. Brandon was also advised to apply ice for any swelling or bruising, perform some neck exercises, use a heat pad or icyhot as needed, and attend physical therapy. Since Brandon was unable to work due to his debilitating neck pain, he would be given time off until the MRI results come out to ascertain the next line of treatment."
virtassist-D2N088,"Andrew, a 59-year-old patient suffering from depression, type two diabetes, and hypertension visited his doctor due to an upper respiratory infection. He had been experiencing fatigue, shortness of breath, and joint pain after doing yard work and thought he might have caught a cold. He has a history of depression but is not on medication for it. He's been managing it with barre classes suggested by his wife. 

Andrew mentioned that he had received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, and had no history of seasonal allergies. The fatigue was particularly noticeable when he exerted himself, such as carrying heavy bags of soil during landscaping. He was also experiencing pain in his elbows and knees, which he attributed to physical exertion. He hadn't developed a cough or fever yet and had no symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

The doctor found scattered ronchi bilaterally on the patient's lungs, edema of his lower extremities, and pain when palpating his elbows during a physical exam. The results of his chest X-ray were clear, showing no signs of pneumonia. However, his hemoglobin A1C levels were slightly high, at eight.

The doctor decided to increase the dosage of his metformin to 1000 milligrams twice daily, and also to continue his current lisinopril prescription for managing his blood pressure. He also arranged a follow-up appointment for monitoring his hemoglobin A1C levels after four months. The doctor gave Andrew Robitussin for his cough and recommended over-the-counter medications for potential fever.

virtassist-D2N089,"Andrea, a 52-year-old female with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux, presented for her annual examination. She has been engaged in active mobility through walking, exercising, and yoga that has considerably alleviated her arthritis. She confirms no recent joint pain, stiffness, or flare-ups and has been taking methotrexate once a week successfully.

She still experiences palpitations related to her atrial fibrillation, particularly when she is under stress. Despite attempts to manage the stress through meditation and other activities, there has been little progress. Last month, an event monitor was used to observe and understand her palpitations more accurately.

With regards to her reflux, the protonix medication and some dietary adjustments like the reduction of soda intake have helped significantly. She reported a period of over five months without a reflux flare-up.

Her physical examination revealed controlled heart rate, a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, clear lungs, erythema and some edema on the right elbow causing some pain, and no lower extremity edema. A report of her event monitor showed she frequently goes in and out of atrial fibrillation.

Doctor's plans include continuing the methotrexate (2.5 mg, once weekly) for Andrea's rheumatoid arthritis, referring her to cardiology for a cardiac ablation due to her frequently changing atrial fibrillation states, and asking her to remain on the protonix (40 mg a day) for reflux. Additionally, Andrea is advised to continue avoiding trigger foods like coffee and spicy foods for her reflux. She demonstrated understanding and agreed to follow all prescribed plans."
virtassist-D2N090,"Albert, a 62-year-old male with a history of depression, Type 2 diabetes, and a kidney transplant was visiting for an emergency room follow-up. Albert experienced elevated blood sugar levels due to lack of monitoring and poor diet, brought on by the stress of his mother's hospital stay. He was feeling unwell over the weekend but improved after the visit. He was not admitted to the hospital.

Recently, Albert has experienced inconsistency in his dietary habits, particularly over the weekends. He acknowledges the need for improvement in managing his diet. Regarding his kidney transplant, Albert has been diligent about taking his immunotherapy medications and his kidney function remains good.

Albert's depression has been challenging over the past year and a half. However, he's found meditation helpful in managing his mood. He plans to continue this approach without any additional therapy or medication for now.

During the physical exam, no significant distress was noted. There were slight abnormalities in his cardiovascular and respiratory exam, including a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur that was previously noted, and 1+ edema in his lower extremities.

His blood sugar was high at 162 despite fasting, and his hemoglobin A1c test came back a little high at 8, indicating that his blood sugar levels have been regularly elevated. The doctor planned to increase his Lantus dose to 20 units at night and intends to monitor his hemoglobin A1c over the next couple of months.

Albert's depression management strategies were satisfactory, so he will continue with his current approach including meditation. Kidney function remains stable and the patient will return to Dr. Reyes to manage immunosuppression medications. The note was then finalized by the doctor."
virtassist-D2N091,"Patient named Jerry, a 54-year-old male, came in for an annual exam. He has a past medical history of osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis. Recently, he has been experiencing stress and lack of sleep due to traveling throughout the summer. Despite trying various strategies like melatonin and meditation, Jerry's insomnia has not improved. 

Jerry's osteoporosis is currently being treated with Fosamax, and he has not experienced any recent joint issues or broken bones. His multiple sclerosis is also under control and he is following up regularly with his neurologist. He takes his medication regularly and has not experienced any problematic side effects. He has been dealing with some weakness related to a previous knee surgery, but that condition is improving. 

In terms of his physical health, Jerry's vital signs are good, his heart and lungs are functioning well, though he shows some weakness in his lower extremities and arthritic changes in his right knee, as confirmed by an x-ray. His reflexes were found to be strong. 

Moving forward, the doctor advised Jerry to continue his Fosamax for osteoporosis, for which a refill was ordered, and to continue seeing the neurologist for his multiple sclerosis. His insomnia issue remained unaddressed, recommending further exploration in subsequent visits.
"
virtassist-D2N092,"Mrs. Martinez, a 43-year-old female, visited Dr. Gomez due to pain located near her wrist, specifically in her distal radius, that occurred while playing tennis. She explained that she missed the ball and hit the pole part of the net, which jarred her arm. She reported a small amount of swelling and a wee bit of pain when she moves her wrist, but no numbness in her hand. Her medical history includes allergies for which she takes Flonase, and a past incident where she fell doing lawn work and stabbed her arm with a rake. Upon examination, Dr. Gomez discovered tenderness over the distal radius when putting stress on it, especially when flexing the thumb.

An X-ray did not show any fractures or abnormalities. Thus, Dr. Gomez diagnosed the affliction as a possible strain or contusion from hitting the arm. A conservative treatment plan was suggested, including ice for the swelling and Motrin (at 800 milligrams three times per day) for the pain. If the condition doesn't improve in about a week's time, a follow-up examination might be needed. The doctor then prescribed the required medications and procedures."
virtassist-D2N093,"Patient Lawrence is a 62-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux. He presented with complaints of shortness of breath, lethargy, and noticed he'd been swelling up a bit after attending parties and eating salty foods, with symptoms worsening when climbing stairs. This has been going on for about 10 days. 

He has also been experiencing discomfort and stiffness lying flat in bed, and having trouble adjusting to walking in the morning. He woke up acutely short of breath once about a week ago. 

Regarding his diabetes, he reported no observed spike in his blood sugars and is generally good about monitoring, except sometimes on busy weekends. He is currently on an insulin pump. He disclosed he eats chocolate bars relatively frequently. 

In terms of his depression, the patient indicated a rough year and a half but has tried natural solutions such as outdoor stretches. He does not wish to try medications but is open to suggestions. 

His reflux, which was being treated with omeprazole along with lifestyle modifications, seems to be under control. His alcohol intake has been more challenging during the holiday season. 

Physical exam findings included a slight 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur, some crackles bilaterally at the bases of his lungs, and 1+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. The doctor noted no other major symptoms, and chest x-ray and labs were largely normal. 

The doctor diagnosed an acute exacerbation of heart failure, likely due to dietary indiscretion and fluid retention, prescribing 40 mg of Lasix daily and instructing Lawrence to weigh himself daily and to contact the doctor if his weight increases or his shortness of breath worsens. 

For the diabetes management, he ordered a future hemoglobin A1C and wants Lawrence to have a recent eye exam, and continue working closely with his endocrinologist. 

His depression management will involve referral to a psychiatrist for talk therapy. 

His reflux should continue to be managed with daily 20 mg of omeprazole. The doctor emphasized the importance of call in the event of a worsening of his breathing issues. No other questions or concerns were raised by the patient at this time."
virtassist-D2N094,"Ms. James, a 42-year-old female, consulted Dr. Cooper for her right index finger pain. The injury occurred five days ago while she was skiing and lost control, jamming her finger. She rated her pain as 7/10 and reported that ibuprofen did not alleviate her symptoms. She did not ice it or put a splint on it. Besides, she has a medical history of chronic constipation and uses Miralax for it. She also had an appendectomy when she was seven. Examination of her hand X-ray showed no fractures, but manipulation of her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint caused pain. The doctor diagnosed her with a sprain of her DIP joint and prescribed her Mobic (15 milligrams once a day, 14 pills) and a splint for her finger. Ms. James is advised to return for a follow-up in two weeks, with consideration for hand therapy if necessary.
"
virtassist-D2N095,"Cheryl, a 34-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, presented with back pain that she experienced about six days ago during a walking routine. She has been lifting more at the gym approximately three times a week and has been using ibuprofen and heat to manage the pain, which is centered in her lower back, affecting both sides equally. There are no symptoms of numbing, tingling, or weakness in her legs or feet.

She has been able to manage her hypertension well with regular readings at home and a controlled diet, helped by her boyfriend, and is on a regimen of lisinopril. She reports a bit of nasal congestion due to seasonal allergies.

Physical examination showed a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur, consistent with past examinations. There was pain palpated on the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine and with lumbar flexion and extension. A straight leg raise test was negative. X-rays of the lumbar spine showed a good boney alignment with no visible fracture, and lab results showed no elevated white blood cell count or signs of infection.

The doctor has assessed the back pain as a lumbar strain possibly due to lifting or exercising. A prescription for Meloxicam, 15 milligrams once a day, along with icing and applying heat to the area, was suggested. The patient was also referred to physical therapy for strengthening of her back. The doctor encouraged her to continue with her lisinopril, 10 milligrams a day, for her hypertension and to monitor any increases in blood pressure readings. She needs a refill of the Lisinopril prescription."
virtassist-D2N096,"Mrs. Anderson, a 44-year-old female, visited the doctor's office complaining of left shoulder pain that had been persisting for a week. She mentioned the discomfort began after a mishap in a gymnastics class. Upon examination, any movement of the left shoulder was painful to the patient. Mrs. Anderson also noted that she had previously had surgery on her left arm. However, the doctor stated that this didn't seem related to her current pain.

She had tried taking Tylenol for 2-3 days, but it provided no relief. The doctor reviewed her x-ray, noting there were no broken bones or fractures. The doctor surmised she likely hurt her joint. As a result, he recommended she take 600mg of Ibuprofen three times a day for a week, apply heat or ice pads to relieve the pain, and to rest her left arm.

The doctor also advised her to avoid carrying heavy weights and to primarily use her right hand for activities in the coming 3-4 weeks for optimal healing. If the pain persisted beyond three weeks, the doctor requested to see her again. Depending on her condition at that time, further x-rays might be warranted. In the case of increasing pain, the doctor suggested she could also try using Advil or Aleve. Mrs. Anderson was asked to call or make an appointment if her condition worsened before the three-week follow-up.
"
virtassist-D2N097,"Elizabeth, a 66-year-old female with a medical history of depression and hypertension, visited her doctor for her annual exam. She's been attending therapy for her depression once a week for the past year and has a good support system with her husband and kids nearby.

She's treating her hypertension using the prescribed Lisinopril and maintaining her blood pressure through regular checkups. She mentioned no additional symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Elizabeth did mention some nasal congestion.

Upon physical examination, the doctor noticed a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur (previously known) and some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally. Elizabeth's EKG results were normal. The doctor suggested paying closer attention to her diet due to the edema.

As for her depression, her doctor found her coping strategies effective and didn't see the need to start medication unless she felt differently, which she did not. For her hypertension, the doctor wants her to continue on the Lisinopril, 20 milligrams a day, and keep monitoring her blood pressure. If the readings begin to rise, she is to contact the doctor. Due to the annual exam maintenance, she's due for a mammogram and it will be scheduled.

Finally, she asked if she could take all her medicines at the same time, to which the doctor affirmed and suggested setting an alarm as a reminder."
virtscribe-D2N098,"Patient named Jose James, born on 9/29/1957, complained of constant pain in his left shoulder and elbow for approximately five months. The pain was caused by a fall on an icy stairway, which particularly impacted his left side. The pain is exacerbated when he tries to lift weights as part of his two days per week gym routine, limiting him from lifting more than 15 or 20 pounds. Mr. James stopped going to the gym due to the pain, but continues to walk 30 minutes daily with his wife. He has tried icing the painful areas, but has not used any medication. His pain is not accompanied by numbness or tingling. 

Dr. Isabella examined him and found a pain source on his left shoulder and elbow. The initial assessment was impingement syndrome of the left shoulder, creating a derivative pain in his wrist. There is no additional injury or issue with the wrist. For treatment, physical therapy was recommended initially, with two sessions per week. If the pain does not improve, a cortisone injection can be considered. Mr. James agreed to this plan. Furthermore, he was advised to continue applying ice, especially to his shoulder, and rest as much as he can. He was asked to contact the healthcare team if symptoms worsen or do not improve with therapy. A referral was requested for Dr. Martha Rivera for physical therapy."
virtscribe-D2N099,"Patient Randy Gutierrez, born on 8/10/2020, reported symptoms of illness since the previous night. He has a runny, clear nose, non-barky cough, and has been pulling at his ears. He has a low-grade fever of 100.3 degrees. His appetite varied as he consumed less than usual from his bottle and rejected cereal. He appeared irritable and was fighting sleep. Randy's older sister had been sick, and he had been exposed to a nephew with a sinus infection. His parent treated him with saline mist in the nose, Tylenol, put baby Vicks on his feet, and used the humidifier. 

Upon physical examination, the doctor noted that Randy's illness appears viral in nature and does not necessitate antibiotics at this point. Suggestions included continued rest, fluids, and observations for a barky cough (which could indicate severity). If such a cough develops, the doctor advised administering half a teaspoon of the sister's medicine. Randy (and his sister) were prescribed the same medication for potential use and further appointments were scheduled.

The doctor reaffirmed the patient should not ingest honey due to insufficient stomach acid to break down botulism spores. As an alternative, agave was suggested.

For Randy's worsening cradle cap, the doctor advised using a standard strength dandruff shampoo (like head & shoulder's, selsun blue, or nizoral AD), along with the existing regimen of a brush and aveno shampoo. This treatment aims to remove dead skin scales and prevent their recurrence; it should be used twice weekly. The parent was warned to avoid getting the shampoo in Randy's eyes due to its pH imbalance. 

He does not have Covid-19 and it was suggested that the patient continues observing the symptoms and returns for a follow-up visit in one week."
virtscribe-D2N100,"Patient Kayla Ward, born on 4/28/07 and with MRN 3-8-4-9-2-0, visited Dr. Juan Price with her mother for mild to moderate acne located on her face, which started about two years ago. She has been using Persa-Gel and washing regularly, which has been somewhat helpful. There are no associated symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or pain.

Kayla also reported her acne doesn't flare with her periods and she has been having a regular period for the last two years. The biggest flare in her acne was noticed when she started school sports in the fall. Examination revealed multiple benign nevi (moles) on the trunk and extremities, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared.

Dr. Price prescribed new topical therapy. The new regimen includes washing face with a mild cleanser, using ""noncomedogenic"" moisturizer with SPF 30 or higher in the morning, and using the same cleanser in the evening followed by adapalene 0.1% cream and Persa-Gel, finishing with a noncomedogenic moisturizer. The patient will start with a few nights a week and move towards using it every night. As the gel will cause sensitivity, she's reminded to use sunscreen when going outside. 

The doctor also mentioned that the multiple moles observed on Kayla's arms, legs, back, and abdomen are benign. A follow-up appointment is set for six months later to monitor her progress. The doctor encourages her to reach out should any issues or queries arise before their next visit."
virtscribe-D2N101,"Patient Julia Jones, born on 5/16/1996, met with Dr. Gonzalez for a consult about a breast reduction procedure. Julia has been considering a breast reduction for several years, experiencing symptoms such as back pain, neck pain, and occasional numbness or tingling. She wears a G cup but mostly chooses to wear a 34E sports bra for comfort. Julia does not wear a regular bra that often due to cost and discomfort but does confirm she gets indentations from her bra straps. 

Due to the physical discomfort, Julia's activities are limited, specifically working out, jumping, or running. She has been going to a chiropractor for a few years due to her back pain, and she also takes propranolol for migraines. 

She has a family history of breast cancer, with her mother diagnosed at age 40. Recommendations for Julia were to start mammograms at age 30, but she's still five years away from that.

Julia does not have any children, but she might plan to have some in the future. She has Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance, but her provider may be changing as her husband accepted a new job, likely taking effect in July. 

Dr. Gonzalez has identified Julia as a good candidate for a breast reduction, assuring her that it’s a common procedure she performs weekly. She explains the procedure, which includes making an incision around the nipple, lifting the breast, and removing extra fat and breast tissue. They will aim for a small C cup, but the final size will depend on the blood supply, maintaining nipple viability. The surgery will take approximately three hours with drains in place for around a week and will require a night’s stay at the hospital. 

The doctor explains potential changes post-procedure, such as the inability to breastfeed or alterations in the nipple sensation due to the removal of glands and fat from the breast. Julia is also advised that future weight gains, pregnancy, hormonal changes could affect the size and shape of her breasts.

Dr. Gonzalez advises submitting consultation details and photos to Julia's new insurance provider once confirmed in July. The doctor believes she meets all the insurance requirements for a medically necessary procedure and expects approval based on Julia's symptoms and the negative impacts on her life. Dr. Gonzalez's physical examination confirms severe ptosis (sagging) and asymmetrical breasts. Once the process is underway, they’ll submit for an insurance approval and schedule the surgical procedure."
virtscribe-D2N102,"Kelly Wood, born on February 15, 1979, visited the doctor for a renal ultrasound following episodes of hematuria. Her urine dipstick results were negative for leukocytes, nitrates, protein, ketone, bilirubin and glucose but indicated a trace amount of blood. The renal ultrasound revealed a non-obstructing 6mm stone in her left kidney. She previously passed two small stones which led to her hematuria symptoms. The patient disclosed she had been experiencing intense urinary pain, rating it an 8 out of 10. She confirmed she has no current flank pain or tenderness in her lower back after passing the stones, and her only medication is Alavert 10 milligrams daily.

The doctor explained to Mrs. Wood that kidney stones were the cause of the blood in her urine, and recommended no surgical intervention as the remaining stone is not causing pain or obstruction. Mrs. Wood asked for advice to prevent future stones and was advised to hydrate properly, reduce sodium oxalate and animal protein in her diet, and consume less than 1000 milligrams of sodium a day. The doctor also provided a handout outlining dietary recommendations to avoid kidney stones.

The doctor concluded the consultation with a plan to see Mrs. Wood for a follow-up next year unless she experiences further issues like bleeding or pain. She was advised to visit the emergency room for severe pain or bright red blood in her urine. The primary diagnosis was hematuria, and the secondary diagnosis was chronic urolithiasis."
virtscribe-D2N103,"Melissa Sanchez, DOB 9/23/1962, MRN: 5484367, has had a mitral valve repair on 8/3/2020. She has a history of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, asthma and recurrent chest discomfort. ECG taken on 12/26/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and T-wave inversion anteriorly. During her appointment, she reported that her overall health has improved post-surgery but she experiences occasional chest pain and shallow breathing, especially under exertion. These symptoms last for a few minutes and then disappear for a couple of weeks. She is taking Coumadin, Lasix, and Atenolol. She initially reported irritability as a side effect of Atenolol, but she seems to have adjusted to this. Her physical assessment showed no JVD detected in the head and neck, lungs have reduced breath but clear auscultation and percussion, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, accentuated S1 with no S3, and trace peripheral edema on extremities. The doctor found her heart valves to be working well, and her condition controlled with medication. She will continue with current medication and is to return for a follow-up in six to nine months."
virtscribe-D2N104,"Judy Gomez, born on 5/7/1961 and with a Medical Record Number of 869723, was in the doctor's office for ongoing management of her psoriatic arthritis. She had been taking prednisone and methotrexate. She confirmed that she decreased her prednisone dose to one, but took an extra dose about once a week due to extra pain in her feet on days when she was more active. The doctor and patient agreed to discontinue prednisone. 

The methotrexate had been working well for her joint pain. However, Judy revealed that she skipped the methotrexate the week she got her first COVID-19 vaccine shot due to fears of it interfering with the vaccine's efficacy. This led to a temporary worsening of her condition until she resumed taking it. For the second dose, they advised her to take her methotrexate as usual. 

Judy asked about recent bruising she had, which the doctor informed her was a side effect of prednisone. Looking at Judy's joints and feet, the doctor noted ridges in Judy's nails due to psoriasis. The doctor instructed Judy to continue her methotrexate but to discontinue prednisone and to get a blood work appointment. The doctor was pleased with her treatment progress and planned to see her again in three months.
"
virtscribe-D2N105,"Diana Scott, born on 12/8/1920, visited the doctor on 7/9/2021 due to a recent discovery of a heart murmur. She doesn't know how severe the murmur is or what it entails. She hasn't noticed typical symptoms such as chest pain or heart issues, but mentioned shortness of breath if she overexerts herself, severe leg pain for the past month, dizziness (which she takes medication for), and ankle swelling that has been occurring for the past six months. Her fitness has notably declined 70-80% from six months ago, mainly attributed to her leg pain. Diana has also gradually lost around 10 pounds in the past year. 

Family history includes a son who had a heart attack, a brother who had a stroke due to diabetes, and a sister with a heart problem. Diana herself has had several surgeries, and although the specifics weren't discussed, the doctor has them on record.

The doctor conducted a physical examination and identified a systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids, which could indicate aortic stenosis. The doctor recommended Diana for an echocardiogram to assess her overall cardiac structure and function, a potential aortic stenosis, and possibly an ischemic evaluation based on the results.

The doctor also discussed the possibility of halting her simvastatin (for lipids) medication if her PCP suggested it due to the leg pain she is experiencing. Other medications (amlodipine, lisinopril, and levothyroxine) were to be continued. 

Diana was scheduled to come back in three or four weeks to discuss the results of the echocardiogram and the next steps. She will also discuss her statin medication with her PCP."
